Pizza Shop Simulation 
A simulation that represents a pizza shop and different aspects, calculations, and analysis of the shop. The simulation would be based on the perspective of the shop owner. The simulation will go over the different aspects of owning a pizza shop like customers every day, profit calculation, stock calculation, common toppings, prices, and the cost of stock. The user can input up to 7 text files within the command line arguments to be able to see how the shop is doing over 7 days. This will result in a daily summary of the information above and prompt the user to change these items if they want to. The daily summary will display the profit made on that day, the total number of customers, and the leftover inventory based on servings. Also, if 7 days are inputed, a pyplot will display and show the profit trend over the last 7 days.
