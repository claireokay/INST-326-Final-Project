# INST-326-Final-Project
Pizza Shop Simulation 
A simulation that represents a pizza shop and different aspects, calculations, and analysis of the shop. The simulation would be based on the perspective of the shop owner. The simulation will go over the different aspects of owning a pizza shop like random customers every day , profit calculation, stock calculation, common toppings, prices, and the cost of stock. The user could select the amount of inventory, the price of each topping, and the number of days the simulation will run. This will result in a daily summary of the information above and prompt the user to change these items if they want to. The daily summary will display the profit made on that day, the total number of customers, and the leftover inventory based on servings.
